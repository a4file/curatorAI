      "content": "The 〈Christmas〉 series reinterprets Christmas symbols through the cycle of life and death. The deer skull transforms the traditional symbol into an image of mortality. The snowy winter landscape and dark sky create a serene yet lonely atmosphere, hinting at the cycle of life. The thick impasto technique emphasizes the raw textures of nature, reminding viewers of its power and the transience of life. Each piece is priced at 1,200,000 won."
